# ⚽ Premier League 2024–25: Data-Driven Team of the Season (TOTS)

## 🧠 What is this?
This is a football analytics project that builds a **data-driven Team of the Season (TOTS)** for the Premier League 2024–25 — based purely on statistical performance, not media hype or votes.

For the first iteration, the analysis is entirely SQL-based, using a custom database of collected stats to evaluate players position by position.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To identify the most effective players in each position using real performance data and a custom weighting system — starting with SQL queries to rank players based on normalized and weighted metrics.

## 🔄 Current Status

- ✅ Created project repo and file structure
- ✅ Collected player-level stats into a demo database
- ✅ Writing SQL queries to calculate scores and rankings
